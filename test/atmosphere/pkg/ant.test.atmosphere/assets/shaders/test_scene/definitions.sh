/*<h2>atmosphere/definitions.glsl</h2>

<p>This GLSL file defines the physical types and constants which are used in the
main <a href="functions.glsl.html">functions</a> of our atmosphere model, in
such a way that they can be compiled by a GLSL compiler (a
<a href="reference/definitions.h.html">C++ equivalent</a> of this file
provides the same types and constants in C++, to allow the same functions to be
compiled by a C++ compiler - see the <a href="../index.html">Introduction</a>).

<h3>Physical quantities</h3>

<p>The physical quantities we need for our atmosphere model are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometry">radiometric</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(optics)">photometric</a>
quantities. In GLSL we can't define custom numeric types to enforce the
homogeneity of expressions at compile time, so we define all the physical
quantities as <code>float</code>, with preprocessor macros (there is no
<code>typedef</code> in GLSL).

<p>We start with six base quantities: length, wavelength, angle, solid angle,
power and luminous power (wavelength is also a length, but we distinguish the
two for increased clarity).
*/

#define Length float
#define Wavelength float
#define Angle float
#define SolidAngle float
#define Power float
#define LuminousPower float

/*
<p>From this we "derive" the irradiance, radiance, spectral irradiance,
spectral radiance, luminance, etc, as well pure numbers, area, volume, etc (the
actual derivation is done in the <a href="reference/definitions.h.html">C++
equivalent</a> of this file).
*/

#define Number float
#define InverseLength float
#define Area float
#define Volume float
#define NumberDensity float
#define Irradiance float
#define Radiance float
#define SpectralPower float
#define SpectralIrradiance float
#define SpectralRadiance float
#define SpectralRadianceDensity float
#define ScatteringCoefficient float
#define InverseSolidAngle float
#define LuminousIntensity float
#define Luminance float
#define Illuminance float

/*
<p>We  also need vectors of physical quantities, mostly to represent functions
depending on the wavelength. In this case the vector elements correspond to
values of a function at some predefined wavelengths. Again, in GLSL we can't
define custom vector types to enforce the homogeneity of expressions at compile
time, so we define these vector types as <code>vec3</code>, with preprocessor
macros. The full definitions are given in the
<a href="reference/definitions.h.html">C++ equivalent</a> of this file).
*/

// A generic function from Wavelength to some other type.
#define AbstractSpectrum vec3
// A function from Wavelength to Number.
#define DimensionlessSpectrum vec3
// A function from Wavelength to SpectralPower.
#define PowerSpectrum vec3
// A function from Wavelength to SpectralIrradiance.
#define IrradianceSpectrum vec3
// A function from Wavelength to SpectralRadiance.
#define RadianceSpectrum vec3
// A function from Wavelength to SpectralRadianceDensity.
#define RadianceDensitySpectrum vec3

#define Luminance3 vec3
// A vector of 3 illuminance values.
#define Illuminance3 vec3

/*
<p>Finally, we also need precomputed textures containing physical quantities in
each texel. Since we can't define custom sampler types to enforce the
homogeneity of expressions at compile time in GLSL, we define these texture
types as <code>sampler2D</code> and <code>sampler3D</code>, with preprocessor
macros. The full definitions are given in the
<a href="reference/definitions.h.html">C++ equivalent</a> of this file).

<h3>Physical units</h3>

<p>We can then define the units for our six base physical quantities:
meter (m), nanometer (nm), radian (rad), steradian (sr), watt (watt) and lumen
(lm):
*/

const Wavelength nm = 1.0;

const SolidAngle sr = 1.0;
const Power watt = 1.0;
const LuminousPower lm = 1.0;

/*
<p>From which we can derive the units for some derived physical quantities,
as well as some derived units (kilometer km, kilocandela kcd, degree deg):
*/

const float PI = 3.14159265358979323846;

const Area m2 = m * m;
const Volume m3 = m * m * m;
const Angle pi = PI * rad;

const Irradiance watt_per_square_meter = watt / m2;
const Radiance watt_per_square_meter_per_sr = watt / (m2 * sr);
const SpectralIrradiance watt_per_square_meter_per_nm = watt / (m2 * nm);
const SpectralRadiance watt_per_square_meter_per_sr_per_nm =
    watt / (m2 * sr * nm);
const SpectralRadianceDensity watt_per_cubic_meter_per_sr_per_nm =
    watt / (m3 * sr * nm);
const LuminousIntensity cd = lm / sr;
const LuminousIntensity kcd = 1000.0 * cd;
const Luminance cd_per_square_meter = cd / m2;
const Luminance kcd_per_square_meter = kcd / m2;

/*
<h3>Atmosphere parameters</h3>

<p>Using the above types, we can now define the parameters of our atmosphere
model. We start with the definition of density profiles, which are needed for
parameters that depend on the altitude:
*/

// An atmosphere layer of width 'width', and whose density is defined as
//   'exp_term' * exp('exp_scale' * h) + 'linear_term' * h + 'constant_term',
// clamped to [0,1], and where h is the altitude.
struct DensityProfileLayer {
  Length width;
  Number exp_term;
  InverseLength exp_scale;
  InverseLength linear_term;
  Number constant_term;
};

// An atmosphere density profile made of several layers on top of each other
// (from bottom to top). The width of the last layer is ignored, i.e. it always
// extend to the top atmosphere boundary. The profile values vary between 0
// (null density) to 1 (maximum density).
struct DensityProfile {
  DensityProfileLayer layers[2];
};

/*
The atmosphere parameters are then defined by the following struct:
*/

struct AtmosphereParameters {
  // The solar irradiance at the top of the atmosphere.
  IrradianceSpectrum solar_irradiance;
  // The sun's angular radius. Warning: the implementation uses approximations
  // that are valid only if this angle is smaller than 0.1 radians.
  Angle sun_angular_radius;
  // The distance between the planet center and the bottom of the atmosphere.
  Length bottom_radius;
  // The distance between the planet center and the top of the atmosphere.
  Length top_radius;
  // The density profile of air molecules, i.e. a function from altitude to
  // dimensionless values between 0 (null density) and 1 (maximum density).
  DensityProfile rayleigh_density;
  // The scattering coefficient of air molecules at the altitude where their
  // density is maximum (usually the bottom of the atmosphere), as a function of
  // wavelength. The scattering coefficient at altitude h is equal to
  // 'rayleigh_scattering' times 'rayleigh_density' at this altitude.
  ScatteringSpectrum rayleigh_scattering;
  // The density profile of aerosols, i.e. a function from altitude to
  // dimensionless values between 0 (null density) and 1 (maximum density).
  DensityProfile mie_density;
  // The scattering coefficient of aerosols at the altitude where their density
  // is maximum (usually the bottom of the atmosphere), as a function of
  // wavelength. The scattering coefficient at altitude h is equal to
  // 'mie_scattering' times 'mie_density' at this altitude.
  ScatteringSpectrum mie_scattering;
  // The extinction coefficient of aerosols at the altitude where their density
  // is maximum (usually the bottom of the atmosphere), as a function of
  // wavelength. The extinction coefficient at altitude h is equal to
  // 'mie_extinction' times 'mie_density' at this altitude.
  ScatteringSpectrum mie_extinction;
  // The asymetry parameter for the Cornette-Shanks phase function for the
  // aerosols.
  Number mie_phase_function_g;
  // The density profile of air molecules that absorb light (e.g. ozone), i.e.
  // a function from altitude to dimensionless values between 0 (null density)
  // and 1 (maximum density).
  DensityProfile absorption_density;
  // The extinction coefficient of molecules that absorb light (e.g. ozone) at
  // the altitude where their density is maximum, as a function of wavelength.
  // The extinction coefficient at altitude h is equal to
  // 'absorption_extinction' times 'absorption_density' at this altitude.
  ScatteringSpectrum absorption_extinction;
  // The average albedo of the ground.
  DimensionlessSpectrum ground_albedo;
  // The cosine of the maximum Sun zenith angle for which atmospheric scattering
  // must be precomputed (for maximum precision, use the smallest Sun zenith
  // angle yielding negligible sky light radiance values. For instance, for the
  // Earth case, 102 degrees is a good choice - yielding mu_s_min = -0.2).
  Number mu_s_min;
