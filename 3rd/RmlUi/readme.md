RmlUi is the C++ user interface package based on the HTML and CSS standards, designed as a complete solution for any project's interface needs. It is a fork of the [libRocket](https://github.com/libRocket/libRocket) project, introducing new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. 

RmlUi uses the time-tested open standards XHTML1.0 and CSS2.0 while borrowing features from HTML5 and CSS3, and extends them with features suited towards real-time applications. Because of this, you don't have to learn a whole new proprietary technology like other libraries in this space. Please have a look at the supported [RCSS properties](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/property_index.html) and [RML elements](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rml/element_index.html).

Documentation is located at https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/

***Note:*** RmlUi 4.0 currently in development is a restructuring of RmlUi 3.x. This includes changes to the namespaces, plugins, and include headers. Take a look at the [changelog](changelog.md#restructuring-rmlui) for a summary of changes and an upgrade guide.

## Features

- Cross platform architecture: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, etc.
- Dynamic layout system.
- Full animation and transform support.
- Efficient application-wide styling, with a custom-built templating engine.
- Fully featured control set: buttons, sliders, drop-downs, etc.
- Runtime visual debugging suite.

## Extensible

- Abstracted interfaces for plugging in to any game engine.
- Decorator engine allowing custom application-specific effects that can be applied to any element.
- Generic event system that binds seamlessly into existing projects.
- Easily integrated and extensible with Lua scripting.

## Controllable

- The user controls their own update loop, calling into RmlUi as desired.
- The library strictly runs as a result of calls to its API, never in the background.
- Input handling and rendering is performed by the user.
- The library generates vertices, indices, and textures for the user to render how they like.
- File handling and the font engine can optionally be fully replaced by the user.


## Integrating RmlUi

Here are the general steps to integrate the library into a C++ application, have a look at the [documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/) for details.

1. Build RmlUi using CMake and your favorite compiler, or fetch the Windows library binaries.
2. Link it up to your application.
3. Implement the abstract [system interface](Include/RmlUi/Core/SystemInterface.h) and [render interface](Include/RmlUi/Core/RenderInterface.h).
4. Initialize RmlUi with the interfaces, create a context, provide font files, and load a document.
5. Call into the context's update and render methods in a loop, and submit input events.
6. Compile and run!

Several [samples](Samples/) demonstrate everything from basic integration to more complex use of the library, feel free to have a look for inspiration.

## Dependencies

- [FreeType](https://www.freetype.org/). However, it can be fully replaced by a custom [font engine](Include/RmlUi/Core/FontEngineInterface.h).
- The standard library.

In addition, a C++14 compatible compiler is required.


## Example: Basic document

In this example a document is created using a templated window. The template is optional but can aid in achieving a consistent look by sharing it between multiple documents.

#### Document

`hello_world.rml`

```html
<rml>
<head>
	<title>Hello world</title>
	<link type="text/template" href="window.rml" />
	<style>
		body
		{
			width: 200px;
			height: 100px;
			margin: auto;
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body template="window">
	Hello world!
</body>
</rml>
```

#### Window template

`window.rml`

```html
<template name="window" content="content">
<head>
	<link type="text/rcss" href="rml.rcss"/>
	<link type="text/rcss" href="window.rcss"/>
</head>
<body>
	<div id="title_header">RmlUi</div>
	<div id="content"/>
</body>
</template>
```
No styles are defined internally, thus `rml.rcss` can be included for [styling the standard elements](Samples/assets/rml.rcss).

#### Style sheet

`window.rcss`

```css
body
{
	font-family: Delicious;
	font-weight: normal;
	font-style: normal;
	font-size: 15px;
	color: #6f42c1;
	background: #f6f8fa;
	text-align: center;
	padding: 2em 3em;
	border: 2px #ccc;
}

#title_header
{
	color: #9a42c5;
	font-size: 1.5em;
	font-weight: bold;
	padding-bottom: 1em;
}
```
