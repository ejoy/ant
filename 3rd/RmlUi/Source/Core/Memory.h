	Global stack allocator.

	Can very cheaply allocate memory using the global stack allocator. Memory will be allocated from the

	Falls back to malloc if there is not enough space left.

	Warning: Using this is dangerous as deallocation must happen in exact reverse order of allocation.
	  Memory is shared between different global stack allocators. Should only be used for highly localized code,
	  where memory is allocated and then quickly thrown away.
